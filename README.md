# Configure-docker-on-managed-node-and-configure-container-as-web-server-using-Ansible
Hello World🌟

This is my first work on ansible, it is an automation tool for cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs. So what all things you will get to know in this article is:

✏How to install and configure ansible on your system

✏How to configure yum for installing docker on managed nodes

✏How to install docker on managed nodes

✏How to launch container and configure web-server on managed nodes


This all is done automatically on any number of system and one of the best things about it is, we don't have to mention "how to do it?" we just have to tell "what to do?".
